This project was created using HTML, CSS, React and Express JS, Jest

The project structure includes a client folder, which contains a src folder with App.js (React) and index.css (CSS). The backend is implemented in Superhero_backend.js, while validation is handled in app.test.js.

Commands used to run fronted is npm start and for backend npm run dev

I also added folder Results that includes collection of the screenshot which represents output of the application

I completed all tasks including optional and additional points

1. If I were collaborating with a team, I would expand this project by adding new features, such as allowing users to edit and delete their inputs. Additionally, I would integrate a database for data storage, opting for a NoSQL solution like MongoDB.I would also consider using a third-party API to enhance the user experience. For example, when a user enters new superheroes and views the list, a small button next to each hero could provide additional details, such as their creation date, creator, and appearances in episodes and comics. Furthermore, I would explore design patterns to improve the applicationâ€™s structure and ensure it is fully responsive across all devices.

2.If I had more time, I would focus on improving the visual presentation of the hero list, exploring alternative data rendering methods beyond a simple table. I would also refine the input fields, ensuring users cannot enter numbers in the name and superpower fields or leave them empty. Additionally, I would implement a fix to prevent duplicate entries upon submission.
Furthermore, I would dedicate more time to error handling and code refactoring to enhance maintainability and efficiency. The majority of my time, however, would be spent learning Jest, as I have never used it before.
